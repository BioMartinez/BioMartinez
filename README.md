## About me

In 2023 I started learning for a Quality Assurance. During the course, I acquired skills and knowledge in the following topics:
- form testing
- desktop and mobile testing
- website testing
- bug report
- test case
- test scenario
- test report
- concepts from the ISTQB syllabus
- Devtools
- REST API testing with Postman
- relational database (MS SQL)

Now, I am training intensively in automatic testing by participating in a course from [jaktestowac.pl](https://jaktestowac.pl/):
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Automatic tests with Playwright (AAA, DRY, POM, GIT, Prettier)
- Visual Studio Code

I'm in the middle of a thirty-day challenge with [Postman](https://quickstarts.postman.com/guide/30-days-of-postman/#0) : Day #16
The challenge includes, among others:
- Forking and running a collection
- Setting variables and environments
- Authorization (OAuth 2.0)
- Tests, Scripting, Debugging
- Mock services
- Monitoring
- Newman

Since January 2024, I have also been working for uTest as a tester.
